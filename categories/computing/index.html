I will retain existing post comments, as there are so few but they are useful. The new static site will not allow new comments to be posted. I'm not sure I want to go with something like Disqus.</div>

 Faster No tracking Can run Add-Ons (Extensions) on mobile  I was very impressed, especially with Tracking Protection, how much faster Firefox has become. Number 2 refers to all your browsing data being sent to Google HQ, encrypted I imagine, but still. And for number 3, on Android certain sites would have 3rd party ads that redirected the browser from the new article or whatever page I was reading to some spammy ad page.</div>

	<div class="post__content">So, WarpWallet is a so-called brain wallet for Bitcoin. That is, you only have to remember a relatively short password and it generates the corresponding private key for use. It uses a memory and CPU hard set of cryptographic algorithms to ensure that brute-forcing is slowed way down. That is, when generating the private key, it takes considerable time. Their Javascript implementation takes over 10 seconds on my machine.
So the makers of it had challenges setup.</div>

	<div class="post__content"><p>I bought and really like my Kenwood Excelon DDX9903S headunit. I had it in my WRX, and moved it to my LS430. It supports Android Auto and CarPlay, which I find really useful when driving.</p>
<p>However, it has a nag screen every time it boots up. This got me curious as to how it worked, and see if it could be patched to skip this disclaimer. I figured it probably ran Linux on a SoC, as pretty much everything does nowadays. So I grabbed the latest firmware for it (mine was already updated to it), and started probing.</p>
<p><code>S_V2_7_0008_0600_AT1.zip</code></p>
<p>Extract that and you get 3 folders under S_V2_7_0008_0600/:</p>

MAIN_V1_0_2758_0400/
SOC_V2_7_0008_0600/
</pre>
<p>In each there's a .nfu file, which I've never encountered before. I ran binwalk on each:</p>

	<div class="post__content"><p>My RAID6 was originally planned with 6 drives, but only had 5 for a while due to space concerns with the case. However, I found as a file, media, and multiple cryptocurrency node it filled up the 2.7TB pretty quickly. So, I got a new case (and some more RAM), which has proper space for 6 3.5&rdquo; drives (and 2 5.25&rdquo;). When migrating to this I decided to add the extra 1TB WD Red NAS drive I bought but have not been able to use.</p>
<p>The case is a Fractal Design Define Mini, and I am thoroughly impressed. Six 3.5&rdquo; slots, two 5.25&rdquo; external slots, and lots of sound padding on the doors and sides.</p>

	<div class="post__content">For Windows 7, this turned out to be pretty easy to do via PowerShell. I just had to look for a native image resizing library since the lock screen for some odd reason, only supports JPEGs up to 256KB in size. Probably one of those legacy items left over from NT, like the file system permissions dialogs, and the built-in environment variables editor&hellip;
I ended up using WIA's ImageProcess COM library which worked surprisingly well.</div>

	<div class="post__content">I noticed during the (many) meetings I attend that disconnecting and reconnecting my laptop from the dock reorganizes all my windows to the laptop's display. This got annoying to have to drag and resize everything when returning to my desk, which has a 3 monitor setup. So, I wrote this small Win32 application to allow you to save the positioning and size of all windows and then restore them at a later time.</div>

	<div class="post__content">I hadn't updated my Raspberry Pi (a B+ model for my rpi-drd project) in about a year. Pacman -Syu kept complaining about being unable to find files on any of the mirrors.
So I, without thinking, ran reflector on an x86 host and copied it over. Oops. Now it definitely can't find packages.
The archlinuxarm.org website gave me the hostname I needed, but not the entire URL. Put this in your mirrorlist (as the sole entry) to restore functionality:</div>

	<div class="post__content">I'm super excited for the imminent onslaught of consumer grade VR equipment and game support. I think it will change how games are played from now on. Not all games, mind you, it takes a certain level of involvement to strap on a head-mounted display and get into the experience. The military already uses similar technology extensively for training. It's just a matter of months before equipment hits shelves.
That said, there's a serious problem with it already.</div>
