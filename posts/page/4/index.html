	<div class="post__content">Well, I've only been working on it a little so far, but I suppose it's good enough to post about at this point.
The site is msqur.com, and it's for Megasquirt ECU users to share their tunes (from the TunerStudio MS software). You can upload (multiple) .msq files, assign some engine information to them at upload, and share them with other people for troubleshooting or tuning help. The goal is to make something easier than attaching a file to a forum post that others have to download and fire up the full tuning software suite to just view it.</div>

	<div class="post__content">So you've got a bunch of parts, assembly is pretty easy. I'm going to skip over most of the chassis assembly since it came with instructions, but I have a couple pointers and I'll go over how I attached the encoders. Then I'll talk about soldering the motor controller and wiring the encoders up, and which pins to pick from the GPIO of the Pi.
So this is what the chassis looks like fully assembled:</div>

	<h1 class="post__title title-excerpt"><a class="post__title-link" href="/installing-arch-linux-with-an-encrypted-root/">Installing Arch Linux with an encrypted root</a></h1>
	<div class="post__content"><p>I've got a ThinkPad T410. I got it off craigslist in what was a somewhat shady transaction. Regardless, it came with a 300GB spinner. Not interested in finding out how much life was left on it I got a solid state replacement from NewEgg for &ldquo;Cyber Monday&rdquo;. A 240GB Intel one for $110, that's less than 50 cents per GB!</p>
<p>The spinner has a single unencrypted partition with Arch Linux running on it. I wanted to run Arch on an encrypted partition. The main reason: If it's ever stolen I don't want to have to worry about any of the data on it. Bonus reason: Geek/spy points.</p>
<p>So, while there are excellent guides for installing Arch, and setting up encryption, and optimizing an SSD, there don't seem to be any combining the three. In reality it's not that much more difficult, and if you are motivated to setup encryption on Linux in the first place you probably know what you're doing. Still, I was disheartened a bit at the lack of information so I decided to note how I went about it in general.</p></div>

	<h1 class="post__title title-excerpt"><a class="post__title-link" href="/raspberry-pi-robot-cross-compiling/">Raspberry Pi – Cross-compiling</a></h1>
	<div class="post__content"><p>Now that you have the hardware built and tested (although that's not necessary), you can either use the code I've written-which is specific to the hardware and environment I have, or compile your own version. If you want to compile your own there are two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compile on the Pi itself</li>
<li>Compile on an ARM virtual machine</li>
<li>Cross-compile on a faster machine</li>
</ol>
<p>The trade off? Compiling on the Pi is slow (very slow). The virtual machine is a marked improvement for compiling speed, but is complicated to setup. Cross-compiling is about the same difficulty as setting up a virtual machine but a bit faster and less &ldquo;bulky&rdquo;. So it depends. The virtual machine is nice if you have a lot of libraries you want to use, since you'll have to compile all of them to be available for linking. If any of them have poor autoconfig support, it might be a pain to fix if you weren't already on the target machine. But, since I just needed one or two popular libraries, I decided to setup cross-compiling from my host (x86_64) machine.</p>
<p>The last time I setup cross-compiling it was on Gentoo, and it wasn't pleasant. However, after a little bit of research it looks like the <a href="https://crosstool-ng.org/" target="_blank">crosstool-ng project</a> is pretty popular and useful. I only had to patch one tiny thing.</p>
<p>Here's the overall process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install crosstool-ng</li>
<li>Configure a cross toolchain with it</li>
<li>Try and build the toolchain</li>
<li>Use the toolchain to build your Pi code</li>

	<div class="post__content"><p>Out of the box the Galileo is setup to run sketches uploaded from volatile memory, which is really lame. I didn't spend much time with it using the stock SPI kernel. So, an SD card is pretty much required to do any serious development with this board. This is not a bad thing (although you aren't running in real-time anymore), since having a full OS to use has lots of advantages. Plus, this way I can automate the build process in a way I'm more familiar with.</p></div>

	<div class="post__content">Over a year ago I got an Arduino Uno and a CAN-BUS Shield to try and make some kind of datalogger for my car. I was also interested in using the OpenXC library with it (which might need a port if there isn't one already, since it uses the Digilent chipKIT Max32 development board). While OpenXC allows interfacing with Android stuff for phones, I'm more interested in a self-contained datalogging type deal.</div>

	<div class="post__content">Well, with less than a couple hundred miles on the rebuilt engine, it was time to really break-in the new VG33. I took it to an autocross. Things were going well until I shut it off after my second run. It didn't want to restart after that. It appears that the culprit was low battery voltage, as the ECU was resetting and the fuel pump never even came on during cranking.</div>

	<div class="post__content">Continuing from part 1, this is the start of installation and results of the LED conversion. I ordered a small bunch of LEDs to get a feel for what brightness I'm looking at since the website I ordered from has somewhat confusing &lsquo;relative intensity&rsquo;, &lsquo;brightness&rsquo;, and &lsquo;lumens&rsquo; listed for each bulb. Not to mention the prices seemed to fluctuate independently of any of those values so it wasn't as simple as &lsquo;find the most expensive ones&rsquo;.</div>
