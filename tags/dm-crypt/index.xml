      <title>Installing Arch Linux with an encrypted root</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve got a ThinkPad T410. I got it off craigslist in what was a somewhat shady transaction. Regardless, it came with a 300GB spinner. Not interested in finding out how much life was left on it I got a solid state replacement from NewEgg for &amp;#8220;Cyber Monday&amp;#8221;. A 240GB Intel one for $110, that&amp;#8217;s less than 50 cents per GB!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spinner has a single unencrypted partition with Arch Linux running on it. I wanted to run Arch on an encrypted partition. The main reason: If it&amp;#8217;s ever stolen I don&amp;#8217;t want to have to worry about any of the data on it. Bonus reason: Geek/spy points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while there are excellent guides for installing Arch, and setting up encryption, and optimizing an SSD, there don&amp;#8217;t seem to be any combining the three. In reality it&amp;#8217;s not that much more difficult, and if you are motivated to setup encryption on Linux in the first place you probably know what you&amp;#8217;re doing. Still, I was disheartened a bit at the lack of information so I decided to note how I went about it in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
