      <title>Msqur Update v0.53b</title>
      <link>https://blog.nearwood.net/msqur-update-v0-53b/</link>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve rolled out the update 0.53b to msqur.com. This includes:
 INI Parsing (i.e. better MSQ support) Bug fixes and better error handling  So now it is a bit more usable. The INI Parsing turns out to be a bit more complex than I anticipated, but I rolled out a decent intermediate update in the meantime.
Before completing the INI parsing (or anything else for that matter), I&amp;#8217;ve decided to overhaul the entire codebase.</description>

      <title>Carduino 2.0 – Intel Galileo Setup</title>
      <link>https://blog.nearwood.net/carduino-2-0-intel-galileo-setup/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Out of the box the Galileo is setup to run sketches uploaded from volatile memory, which is really lame. I didn&amp;#8217;t spend much time with it using the stock SPI kernel. So, an SD card is pretty much required to do any serious development with this board. This is not a bad thing (although you aren&amp;#8217;t running in real-time anymore), since having a full OS to use has lots of advantages. Plus, this way I can automate the build process in a way I&amp;#8217;m more familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Over a year ago I got an Arduino Uno and a CAN-BUS Shield to try and make some kind of datalogger for my car. I was also interested in using the OpenXC library with it (which might need a port if there isn&amp;#8217;t one already, since it uses the Digilent chipKIT Max32 development board). While OpenXC allows interfacing with Android stuff for phones, I&amp;#8217;m more interested in a self-contained datalogging type deal.</description>

      <description>I update Custom Speed to 1.1. Changes include:
 An actual theme (consistent colors) More units New icon  2.0 will include an actual settings page that will allow the units to be selected from an easier control, a setting for keeping the display on, and other minor UI improvements. There&amp;#8217;s no ETA currently for 2.0.</description>

      <title>Refactoring with regular expressions</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m re-learning JavaScript, and I noticed I was refactoring functions a lot on some old code. I&amp;#8217;m putting some useful stuff here for reference:
aFunc(blah) → this.aFunc = function(blah)
Find: function (\w+)(
Replace with: this.\1 = function(
&amp;nbsp;
To go the other way:
Find: \t(\w+)\s=\sfunction(
Replace with: \tfunction \1(
&amp;nbsp;
Change aFunc(blah) to SOME.qualifier.aFunc(blah)
Find: \t(\w+()
Replace with: \tSOME.qualifier.\1</description>
