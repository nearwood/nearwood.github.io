      <description>After installing Windows 7 in place of OS X on my MacBook Pro for work, there are only a few things I miss. But man, they were really nice.
 Unix shell Time Machine  The first one I&#39;ll just say if you haven&#39;t used a Unix-like shell of some type (Bash, zsh, whatever) then it&#39;s hard to explain. Just that you can do everything a GUI can do (save for graphics work), but much, much faster.</description>

      <title>OS X? Unimpressive.</title>

      <description>I&#39;ve been working with a MacBook Pro and OS X 10.8.2, and I have to say I&#39;m not impressed. Coming from a background that consisted almost entirely of Windows and Linux, it isn&#39;t all it&#39;s cracked up to be. It&#39;s still another OS with it&#39;s own set of problems.
That said, the user interface is more consistent and usable, in a lot of cases, than Windows and especially Linux desktop environments.</description>
