      <description>I&amp;#8217;m super excited for the imminent onslaught of consumer grade VR equipment and game support. I think it will change how games are played from now on. Not all games, mind you, it takes a certain level of involvement to strap on a head-mounted display and get into the experience. The military already uses similar technology extensively for training. It&amp;#8217;s just a matter of months before equipment hits shelves.
That said, there&amp;#8217;s a serious problem with it already.</description>
