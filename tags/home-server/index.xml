      <description>I&#39;ve pulled power and cable from the attic and just powered up the home server again. It&#39;s been asleep for 5 months until now. I&#39;ve just done an emerge -sync, and it took about 10 minutes to complete.
However, it went up without any problems, which is good. Considering I turned it off in a working state. I was tempted to backup all my config files and start fresh with, say, Arch Linux, but that would take all weekend.</description>
