      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve pulled power and cable from the attic and just powered up the home server again. It&amp;#8217;s been asleep for 5 months until now. I&amp;#8217;ve just done an emerge &amp;#8211;sync, and it took about 10 minutes to complete.
However, it went up without any problems, which is good. Considering I turned it off in a working state. I was tempted to backup all my config files and start fresh with, say, Arch Linux, but that would take all weekend.</description>
