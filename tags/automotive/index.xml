      <description>So, am I the first? The first to put a VG33 in an S30? I have doubts but I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of it before. After a bit of late night work and an unplanned oil event and a small unplanned fuel dump after removing and replacing the engine to fix the oil leak, it&amp;rsquo;s back in, running, and more importantly: not leaking.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a late night in-progress shot:
 All the work was worth it, I had to get it running for a scheduled photoshoot:</description>

      <title>280Z SpeedHut gauge conversion</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I acquired some Speedhut gauges a while back for a deal, and I just got a free 240Z wheel, so I decided to do all three. In this part I just remove and fit the Speedhut gauges in the old speedo and tachometer housings. In the next part I wire them up. A few people did this on HybridZ various different ways. I was too cheap to go out and get any other supplies, so I made it work with what I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gauges I got are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speedometer: 4&amp;rdquo; Revolution GPS Speedo with integrated fuel gauge, turn signal LEDs, and high-beam LED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tachometer: 4&amp;rdquo; Revolution 8,000RPM with programmable shift LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both have red dials, and red illumination. The fuel gauge is there since I&amp;rsquo;ll be replacing the one in the 3 small dash gauges eventually, but don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose having a gas gauge.&lt;/p&gt;
