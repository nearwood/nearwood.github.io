      <description>For the past week our internet service has been slowed to a crawl. Like, dial-up speeds: 0.8&amp;frasl;0,1 Mbps (so 100 kB/s down, 12 kB/s up). I tried restarting our 8 year old modem, our brand new router. I eventually gave up and called Comcast and had a cable guy come out and check the signal level. He says it&amp;rsquo;s fine, but our modem is the culprit. So, I figure he&amp;rsquo;s right and besides, it&amp;rsquo;s an ancient modem anyway.</description>

      <description>I attempted to get a webcam going on our home server. So, I plug it in, and since I&amp;rsquo;ve done this before I ran a script I made to grab an image from the webcam. Which didn&amp;rsquo;t work. So, after checking out why (/dev/video0 node was missing), I noticed that the kernel no longer had support built in.
After going through the kernel options, I realized they changed the v4l and webcam support options around and since I just upgrade using &amp;ldquo;-silentoldconfig&amp;rdquo; (the bad way to do upgrades), it broke whenever I upgraded to 3.</description>
