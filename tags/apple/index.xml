      <description>I&#39;ve been working with a MacBook Pro and OS X 10.8.2, and I have to say I&#39;m not impressed.

      <description>If your sick of your brand new MacBook just working (more or less), and you just feel like modifying your kernel&#39;s source to get your computer to work right, you&#39;ve come to the right place. I (finally) managed to get Gentoo booting on a new MacBook Pro (15&amp;rdquo;, Core i7, mid-2012) alongside OS X 10.8.2. I suppose it actually wasn&#39;t that bad, it could have been much worse. I only had to reinstall OS X once after a wonky partition editor&amp;hellip;.</description>
