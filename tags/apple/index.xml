      <title>OS X? Unimpressive.</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working with a MacBook Pro and OS X 10.8.2, and I have to say I&amp;#8217;m not impressed. Coming from a background that consisted almost entirely of Windows and Linux, it isn&amp;#8217;t all it&amp;#8217;s cracked up to be. It&amp;#8217;s still another OS with it&amp;#8217;s own set of problems.
That said, the user interface is more consistent and usable, in a lot of cases, than Windows and especially Linux desktop environments.</description>

      <description>If your sick of your brand new MacBook just working (more or less), and you just feel like modifying your kernel&amp;#8217;s source to get your computer to work right, you&amp;#8217;ve come to the right place. I (finally) managed to get Gentoo booting on a new MacBook Pro (15&amp;#8243;, Core i7, mid-2012) alongside OS X 10.8.2. I suppose it actually wasn&amp;#8217;t that bad, it could have been much worse. I only had to reinstall OS X once after a wonky partition editor&amp;#8230;.</description>
