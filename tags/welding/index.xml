      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#8217;ve got this autocross bug, despite being a terrible driver. After about 5 seconds of thought, I came to the conclusion that I must get an autocross trailer in order to improve my skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after a bit of research it looked like item #90153 was the thing to get. The key is it has 12&amp;#8243; wheels, whereas the cheaper one (#42708) has 8&amp;#8243; ones. The larger the wheel the less RPM the wheel bearings see, which is good. The increased payload capacity and trailer height were just bonuses. Since I plan on hauling some wheels and tires and some tools, I don&amp;#8217;t see coming near the 1000+ lb. payload capacity. And if you wanted to carry more, all you&amp;#8217;d really need is some better tires, since that&amp;#8217;s the actual limiting factor. However, I don&amp;#8217;t recommend carrying anything near the payload capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this is one of the few big-ticket items you can use the 20% coupon on, so if you want to save $46 or so off the price, use one! I got it and built it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-auto alignnone&#34; src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/2yDVaX2l.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;387&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also picked up a trailer jack, LED lighting kit, 1-&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#8243; ball, and ratcheting straps from HF. From elsewhere I got a backup alarm, more LED lights, battery tray, some wire and a voltage gauge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then painted the frame and wheels to match my 280Z:&lt;/p&gt;
