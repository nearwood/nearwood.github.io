      <description>After installing Windows 7 in place of OS X on my MacBook Pro for work, there are only a few things I miss. But man, they were really nice.
 Unix shell Time Machine  The first one I&amp;#8217;ll just say if you haven&amp;#8217;t used a Unix-like shell of some type (Bash, zsh, whatever) then it&amp;#8217;s hard to explain. Just that you can do everything a GUI can do (save for graphics work), but much, much faster.</description>

      <description>If your sick of your brand new MacBook just working (more or less), and you just feel like modifying your kernel&amp;#8217;s source to get your computer to work right, you&amp;#8217;ve come to the right place. I (finally) managed to get Gentoo booting on a new MacBook Pro (15&amp;#8243;, Core i7, mid-2012) alongside OS X 10.8.2. I suppose it actually wasn&amp;#8217;t that bad, it could have been much worse. I only had to reinstall OS X once after a wonky partition editor&amp;#8230;.</description>
