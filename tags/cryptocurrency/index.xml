      <title>Education in Futility: WarpWallet Brute Forcing</title>

      <description>So, WarpWallet is a so-called brain wallet for Bitcoin. That is, you only have to remember a relatively short password and it generates the corresponding private key for use. It uses a memory and CPU hard set of cryptographic algorithms to ensure that brute-forcing is slowed way down. That is, when generating the private key, it takes considerable time. Their Javascript implementation takes over 10 seconds on my machine.
So the makers of it had challenges setup.</description>

      <title>GAWMiner Fury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#8217;m attempting to jump on the Scrypt based ASIC coin mining bandwagon. I got a GAWMiner Fury to try out. It came with a free ZenMiner, which is a Raspberry Pi with a custom image that runs mining software automatically, and connects to a 3rd party website to allow remote control and monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_354&#34; style=&#34;width: 310px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-354&#34; src=&#34;http://www.nearwood.net/wp-content/uploads/IMG_20140606_181256-300x225.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;GAWMiner Fury and ZenMiner&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; srcset=&#34;https://www.nearwood.net/wp-content/uploads/IMG_20140606_181256-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.nearwood.net/wp-content/uploads/IMG_20140606_181256.jpg 1024w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    GAWMiner Fury and ZenMiner
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It came with everything needed to power up and get started. The included instructions just mention how to get started using the ZenMiner, so it&amp;#8217;s pretty skimpy compared to most other packaged products. Being an ASIC cryptocurrency miner, it&amp;#8217;s already a specialty device so you likely know what you are doing. Still, the ZenMiner is geared to newcomers so they can easily start mining. In that respect I think it still needs work as the ZenOS web interface is pretty but limited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
