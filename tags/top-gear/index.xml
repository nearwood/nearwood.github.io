      <description>BBC&amp;#8217;s Top Gear resumes today! I can&amp;#8217;t wait to watch it. It&amp;#8217;s been a while since they left off, and I&amp;#8217;ve been watchin TG:USA in the meantime during my lunch breaks.
TG:USA, will it really work? It just feels so scripted. I know, BBC&amp;#8217;s Top Gear had a rough start too, like many shows. But, I&amp;#8217;m watching season 2 right now, and the chemistry just hasn&amp;#8217;t happened.
I like Tanner, he actually has lines that seem natural.</description>
