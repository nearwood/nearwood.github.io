      <description>I produced some videos in 60 FPS, but couldn&amp;#8217;t remember which ones. Since, of course, I didn&amp;#8217;t label their FPS at the time, I needed to find them in vast sea of 30 FPS videos. Rather than just use a simple grep with ffmpeg to find which ones, I thought it might be more useful to find all videos that have a certain FPS threshold.
Usage: ./60fps.sh [directory]
#!/bin/bash SAVEIFS=$IFS IFS=$&#39;\n&#39; function fpscheck { FPS=$(ffmpeg -i &#34;</description>

      <description>After seeing a fellow MSNE autocrosser post a video with nice data overlays, I asked what datalogger and software he used. It turns out it wasn&amp;#8217;t just a data logger, it was a camera that gathered his speed, acceleration, and so on for him. It was the Garmin Virb Elite. The &amp;#8216;Elite&amp;#8217; part signifying the difference between the non-sensor, data-less variant.
I&amp;#8217;d never heard of it, and I thought I kept at least a cursory eye on the action camera market.</description>
