      <description>After Firefox Quantum was released, I tried it out and decided to switch. I had a few reasons why:
 Faster No tracking Can run Add-Ons (Extensions) on mobile  I was very impressed, especially with Tracking Protection, how much faster Firefox has become. Number 2 refers to all your browsing data being sent to Google HQ, encrypted I imagine, but still. And for number 3, on Android certain sites would have 3rd party ads that redirected the browser from the new article or whatever page I was reading to some spammy ad page.</description>
