      <description>Continuing from part 1, this is the start of installation and results of the LED conversion. I ordered a small bunch of LEDs to get a feel for what brightness I&amp;rsquo;m looking at since the website I ordered from has somewhat confusing &amp;lsquo;relative intensity&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;brightness&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;lumens&amp;rsquo; listed for each bulb. Not to mention the prices seemed to fluctuate independently of any of those values so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as simple as &amp;lsquo;find the most expensive ones&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>My 280Z isn&amp;rsquo;t what you could call &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; in the electrical department. Originally, it came with an externally regulated alternator, fusible links, incandescent bulbs, and very few relays. The design inhereted a few things from Lucas eletronics, which is not a good thing. Regardless, it was fairly normal for the time. I&amp;rsquo;m glad there are no vacuum operated things, like some makes. The most electrically obtuse part of the design is the lack of relays.</description>
