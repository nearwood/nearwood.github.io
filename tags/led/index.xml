      <description>Continuing from part 1, this is the start of installation and results of the LED conversion. I ordered a small bunch of LEDs to get a feel for what brightness I&amp;#8217;m looking at since the website I ordered from has somewhat confusing &amp;#8216;relative intensity&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;brightness&amp;#8217;, and &amp;#8216;lumens&amp;#8217; listed for each bulb. Not to mention the prices seemed to fluctuate independently of any of those values so it wasn&amp;#8217;t as simple as &amp;#8216;find the most expensive ones&amp;#8217;.</description>

      <description>My 280Z isn&amp;#8217;t what you could call &amp;#8220;modern&amp;#8221; in the electrical department. Originally, it came with an externally regulated alternator, fusible links, incandescent bulbs, and very few relays. The design inhereted a few things from Lucas eletronics, which is not a good thing. Regardless, it was fairly normal for the time. I&amp;#8217;m glad there are no vacuum operated things, like some makes. The most electrically obtuse part of the design is the lack of relays.</description>
