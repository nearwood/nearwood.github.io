      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a while from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://nearwood.dev/harbor-freight-trailer-build-part-2/&#34;&gt;last update&lt;/a&gt;, but the build is winding down. That&#39;s good, because I&#39;ve put entirely too much effort into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured out how to secure the tires. Using some 1/8&amp;rdquo; steel angle ($30), I made some mounts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finished up the tail light and signal wiring. I still have 4 LED clearance lights to place somewhere, but I&#39;ll wait until I figure out what else is going on the trailer before placing them, in the hopes I can place them higher up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Harbor Freight Trailer Build</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;ve got this autocross bug, despite being a terrible driver. After about 5 seconds of thought, I came to the conclusion that I must get an autocross trailer in order to improve my skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after a bit of research it looked like item #90153 was the thing to get. The key is it has 12&amp;rdquo; wheels, whereas the cheaper one (#42708) has 8&amp;rdquo; ones. The larger the wheel the less RPM the wheel bearings see, which is good. The increased payload capacity and trailer height were just bonuses. Since I plan on hauling some wheels and tires and some tools, I don&#39;t see coming near the 1000+ lb. payload capacity. And if you wanted to carry more, all you&#39;d really need is some better tires, since that&#39;s the actual limiting factor. However, I don&#39;t recommend carrying anything near the payload capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this is one of the few big-ticket items you can use the 20% coupon on, so if you want to save $46 or so off the price, use one! I got it and built it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also picked up a trailer jack, LED lighting kit, 1-7/8&amp;rdquo; ball, and ratcheting straps from HF. From elsewhere I got a backup alarm, more LED lights, battery tray, some wire and a voltage gauge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then painted the frame and wheels to match my 280Z:&lt;/p&gt;
