      <description>After installing Windows 7 in place of OS X on my MacBook Pro for work, there are only a few things I miss. But man, they were really nice.
 Unix shell Time Machine  The first one I&#39;ll just say if you haven&#39;t used a Unix-like shell of some type (Bash, zsh, whatever) then it&#39;s hard to explain. Just that you can do everything a GUI can do (save for graphics work), but much, much faster.</description>

      <description>Over the years I&#39;ve noticed a couple bugs that are present in in some or all of NT/Vista/7. I experience these on a daily basis, across dozens of computers. So it can&#39;t just be me, right?
 Focus bug. If the timing is right, some windows remain on top despite clicking on a background window. The background window obtains focus, but does not move to the front. This is typically when the foreground window does some focus changing action (Showing a dialog, opening a new tab, etc.</description>

      <description>So much, that it installed multiple copies of the same Flash updates:
Actually, it appears to be a registry glitch rather than multiple copies. As much as I don&#39;t like Adobe&#39;s updating/installation practices (opted-in toolbars, programs), they do have a relatively easy to find and use Flash removal application.

      <title>QEMU on Windows</title>

      <description>After fumbling around with various downloads and patches, I was able to find a working QEMU build for windows. I am running Windows 7 64-bit, and I wanted to run an ARM system (specifically, to develop for a Stratus plug computer). Before this, I was running a virtualized Ubuntu using VirtualBox and then running QEMU within that. Performance was not noticeably bad.
However, I had problems bridging the QEMU to the Ubuntu host, which was bridged itself.</description>
