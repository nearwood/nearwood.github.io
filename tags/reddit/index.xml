      <description>I noticed that my reddit account had a few posts that were too revealing. So, I decided to remove them. I stumbled upon a couple greasemonkey scripts to delete all posts, which got my interested in seeing if I could write up a quick script to do the same that could run in the Developer Tools of any browser, rather than relying on an extension.
The catch is that you, apparently, should edit each comment&amp;#8217;s content to remove it before deleting it, otherwise it&amp;#8217;s still cached in other users&amp;#8217; inboxes or something.</description>
