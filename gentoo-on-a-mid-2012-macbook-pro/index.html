				<div class="post__content"><p>If your sick of your brand new MacBook just working (more or less), and you just feel like modifying your kernel&#8217;s source to get your computer to work right, you&#8217;ve come to the right place. I (finally) managed to get Gentoo booting on a new MacBook Pro (15&#8243;, Core i7, mid-2012) alongside OS X 10.8.2. I suppose it actually wasn&#8217;t that bad, it could have been much worse. I only had to reinstall OS X once after a wonky partition editor&#8230;. edited a little more than I wanted.</p>

<p>What I have in the end is a MacBook Pro that dual boots Gentoo Linux and OS X using rEFInd. Gentoo boots via EFI, I did not use a boot loader (in the traditional sense).</p>

<p>My first attempt&#8211;you know, the one where I left my backup drive at work, was a miserable failure from the get-go. I went with what I was reading online, to use a boot manager/loader. Specifically GRUB/GRUB2 (I tried both). Also I used rEFIt, which has a wobbly gptsync utility, that as far as I can tell, hosed my entire drive. I had even tried building a modified gptsync from source. Although, maybe it was gparted. Since I had problems with that on both occassions.</p>

<p>In either case, I couldn&#8217;t get gparted/parted to change the partition type to linux (0x83 or  82 or whatever it is). It kept reporting that the partition I created was &#8216;MSDOS&#8217;. And in both cases, I shrugged it off because as far as I know, the kernel doesn&#8217;t really care as long as it has the drivers to load the root filesystem&#8217;s actual type.</p>

<p>Where I went wrong in the first case was to attempt to use GRUB/GRUB2 to boot. I had heard that you could use rEFIt to load grub, and then grub would boot the kernel. I didn&#8217;t read a whole lot on EFI booting the kernel directly, so I avoided it. Trying this involved setting up the GPT tables along with legacy MBR tables, and then supposedly I had to &#8216;sync&#8217; them to get rEFIt to see the new partition/OS. Since my OS X partition is encrypted, this caused problems with the gptsync utility. I followed <a href="http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/264528-making-gptsync-in-refit-play-nice-with-filevault-2-for-dual-boot/">these</a> <a href="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-934708.html">two</a> guides which ended up in grub sort of working and OS X completely gone. Oops. I had a backup though.</p>

<p>So I retried it this weekend, convinced that with EFI (even Apple&#8217;s &#8220;EFI&#8221;), you shouldn&#8217;t need any boot manager or loader (other than the EFI program itself). A little more searching and I managed to get it to work. And this skips the whole gptsync fiasco, the GRUB mess, etc.</p>

<p>My first hurdle though, was getting the partitions right. I swear it was a bug in parted or something. Because the man pages online and the one&#8217;s on the minimal Gentoo CD were way different. Any attempts to run the command &#8216;mkpart&#8217; with any of the FS type options would result in a partition with MSDOS type. I eventually just settled with that for reasons I mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>rEFInd seemed to ignore the command line options it&#8217;s own readme specified (specifically, &#8216;&#8211;esp&#8217;). So it ended up installing on the root of the OS X filesystem. I had the EFI (ESP) partition mounted at /boot, so I just moved the files there and re-ran the &#8216;bless&#8217; command.</p>

<p>This is how I did it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Partition: Use disk utility to make a partition for Linux</li>
<li>Install rEFInd</li>
<li>Plug in to your network and reboot to Gentoo CD: I used gentoo-minimal-amd64</li>
<li>Format the new partition: I chose ext4</li>
<li>Obtain stage, initial package sources and unpack/install</li>
<li>Configure and install kernel</li>
<li>Reboot and pray</li>
<li>BCM4331 wireless</li>
<li><a href="http://www.grimsby.us/?p=123" target="_blank">Fixing</a> that annoying &#8216;applesmc: read arg failed&#8217; kernel error message</li>
<li>ethernet</li>
<li>X, audio, etc.?</li>
</ol>

<p>I now have a working Gentoo living along side OS X. It&#8217;s a pain to switch between them, since rEFInd takes ~20 seconds to show up on boot. Now if only I could get X and nvidia-settings to work well with an additional monitor that isn&#8217;t always present, I could do all my work on it.</p>
